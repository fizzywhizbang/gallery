Okay...<br>
                        Welcome to my photo album.<br>
                        <p>
                        I custom wrote this site for myself because I wasn’t happy with the options I found.<br>
                        First, I use Adobe Lightroom for my photo management and as much as I love it the web templates are not what I was looking for. I could have written my own web template but then I still would have to manage an index for all of those albums. So, I wrote my own dynamic page and parse the JSON data from the Lightroom created albums to create my own albums.
I looked at many “simple” gallery viewers and finally found Fancybox. It’s simple to implement and fits perfectly into my own code.</p>

You will need to create a folder/directory named uploaded-content into which you will upload your albums from lightroom.
